In this I use German credit card dataset "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabure/german-credit-data-with-risk" where I perform EDA.
For the resource I use this youtube tutorial video "https://youtu.be/lhI999ETwmA?si=0rEB1GGL785iQ3l1"
This dataset includes features that are helpful for predicting an Individual's creditcard worthiness using past financials.
